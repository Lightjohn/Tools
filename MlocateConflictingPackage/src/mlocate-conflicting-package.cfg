Description: This package prevents 'locate' and 'mlocate' from being installed again.
 If you do not use the mlocate database, then you probably don't want to pay the associated performance price, especially on systems with little memory, where updating the database can render the computer unresponsive for a long time.
 .
 On Debian systems, remove packages 'locate' and 'mlocate', and then install this package to prevent them from ever being installed again.
 .
 This package is not actually a hard, unsurmountable ban, but you should get a conflict warning from your favourite package manager if something wants to install 'locate' or 'mlocate' again.
 .
 Note that, if you just remove package 'mlocate', then tool 'updatedb' ends up referencing "/usr/bin/updatedb.findutils" instead of "/usr/bin/updatedb.mlocate", so you need to remove package 'locate' too.
