backup.sh and backup.bat

These scripts help backup files under Linux and Windows respectively.

They use tools '7z' and 'par2' in order to create compressed and encrypted backup files
with extra redundant data for recovery purposes.

In order to use one of them, copy it to an empty directory and edit the directory paths
to backup and the subdirectories and file extensions to exclude.
