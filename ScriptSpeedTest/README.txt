This is a simple script template to measure how long it takes
to run some test script code or external tool
a given number of iterations.

The script template comes handy if you are trying different ways
to run a program or perform some task in bash and want to have a
rough idea of the difference in performance.

In order to run a test across multiple CPUs, see companion script
synthetic-task.sh
